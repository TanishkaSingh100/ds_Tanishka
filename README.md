# Trader Behavior & Market Sentiment Analysis

**Candidate:** Tanishka

### Project Objective

This project analyzes the relationship between trader behavior and market sentiment using two key datasets. The objective is to identify how trading behavior (profitability, volume) aligns or diverges from overall market sentiment (fear vs greed) and to uncover hidden trends that could influence smarter trading strategies.This was completed as part of the Data Science assignment for the Web3 Trading Team.

### Repository Structure

The repository is structured according to the assignment's submission guidelines:

* [cite_start]`notebook_1.ipynb`: A Google Colab notebook containing all Python code for data cleaning, merging, analysis, and visualization[cite: 9, 10].
* [cite_start]`ds_report.pdf`: The final summary report detailing the project's methodology, findings, and explanations[cite: 19, 25].
* [cite_start]`README.md`: This file, providing an overview and notes on the project[cite: 20, 21].
* `.gitignore`: Specifies files intentionally excluded from the repository.
* [cite_start]`csv_files/`: This directory contains intermediate or processed data files[cite: 15, 22].
    * `sentiment_stats.csv`: Aggregated statistics of trader behavior grouped by market sentiment.
* [cite_start]`outputs/`: This directory contains all visual outputs, graphs, or charts from the analysis[cite: 17, 23, 24].
    * `pnl_by_sentiment.png`: A bar chart showing average profit/loss by sentiment.
    * `leverage_by_sentiment.png`: A bar chart showing average trade size by sentiment.

### A Note on the `cleaned_data.csv` File

The `cleaned_data.csv` file, which is generated by merging the two source datasets, exceeds GitHub's 25MB file size limit and is therefore not included in this repository.

To generate this file and run the full analysis, please execute the cells in the `notebook_1.ipynb` notebook in sequential order. The notebook will create `cleaned_data.csv` in the `csv_files/` directory before proceeding with the analysis and visualization.

### How to Run

1.  The primary analysis is contained in `notebook_1.ipynb`.
2.  [cite_start]It is designed to be run in a Google Colab environment[cite: 10].
3.  The notebook uses standard Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. No special installations are required.
4.  The initial raw data files (`historical_data.csv` and `fear_greed_index.csv`) should be placed in the root Colab environment directory for the notebook to run successfully.
